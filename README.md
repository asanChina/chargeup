# chargeup
rewrite the android code for our ChargeUp app.

ChargeUp is an app which will help people share their phone/tablet chargers.

Most of the time someone would bring their chargers and someone wouldn't. So it helps if there is an app which help people
share their chargers.

ChargeUp allow people to register and coordinate by the backend server, people can search nearby chargers by location and people
can communicate using AWS SNS (push notification service)
